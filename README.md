# Awesome Decentralized Web [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


A curated list of peer-to-peer, federated, and local-first protocols, applications, and developer tools.
Thanks to the [Decentralized Web Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/2018/https://www.decentralizedweb.net/) for the inspiration.

**Scope.** This list is about the *decentralized web*: peer-to-peer protocols, federated applications, and distributed data — projects where decentralization is the core design, not a feature or a marketing claim.

**Out of scope:**
- Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, tokens, NFTs, DAOs, DeFi and other finance-related projects. (Merely *using* an existing blockchain as a neutral public record, with no token of its own, can qualify, see the contributing guide below.)
- AI tools, agent frameworks, and "decentralized AI" platforms.
- Commercial products without significant open-source or decentralized relevance.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a project.

Entries marked **Dormant** still work but their source repository has had no activity for over 2 years — the tag states the measured date. Dead projects live in the Graveyard section at the bottom.

**A quick taxonomy** — four words that often get mixed up:

- **Federated** — many independently operated servers interoperating through a shared protocol; you choose which server to trust instead of trusting a central one. *(Mastodon, Matrix, XMPP)*
- **Peer-to-peer** — participants exchange data directly, with no single authoritative application server; trackers, bootstrap nodes or relays may assist. *(BitTorrent, Scuttlebutt, Tox)*
- **Distributed** — only means data or computation is spread across many machines; centralized services can be distributed too. A distributed system is decentralized only when no single party controls it.
- **Local-first** — the authoritative copy of your data lives on your own device, and the network is optional: sync happens when connectivity allows. *(software built with Automerge, Yjs or Willow)*

## Decentralization at a Glance
A few representative systems — deliberately not all of them — classified on the axes that decide who controls what. Decentralization is not automatically privacy, anonymity, resilience, or censorship resistance: each of those must be designed for separately, and the sibling list awesome-resilient-communication (under *Other Related Lists* below) covers several of them in depth.

|System     |Model                 |User-controlled data|Self-hostable|Offline/LAN|Runs without central relays|Open protocol|Maturity     |

✓ holds by design · ◐ partial or configuration-dependent · ✗ not provided — and in the relay column, ✓ means the system works with no centrally operated helpers at all

The conditional cells, from each project's own documentation:

- Mastodon and Matrix — your data lives on whichever server hosts your account, so full control means self-hosting; Mastodon migration moves followers but not posts, and Matrix replicates room history to every participating homeserver.
- Matrix relays — nothing in the protocol requires it, but matrix.org remains the default homeserver and identity server for a large share of users.
- Bluesky — personal data servers are practical to self-host, but Relays and AppViews are resource-intensive, so the network in practice depends on a few operators.
- Nostr — identity is a client-side keypair, but notes persist only on the relays that accept them; any relay works and clients publish to several at once, yet some relay is always required.
- Delta Chat — rides on ordinary e-mail, so any provider works, but some provider is always in the loop and sees message metadata.
- Scuttlebutt — feeds replicate between mutual follows over LAN or the internet; optional pub and room servers only aid discovery.
- IPFS — content-addressing removes location trust, but content stays retrievable only while some node pins it, and default configurations bootstrap through project-run nodes.
- BitTorrent and Syncthing — swarms bootstrap through trackers or DHT bootstrap nodes; Syncthing's default discovery and relay servers are project-run but self-hostable, and pure-LAN sync needs neither.
- Radicle — repositories are local Git; sharing them requires seed nodes your peers can reach.
- Solid — the specification is stable on paper (protocol 0.9, 2021) but deployments remain small.

## Choose by Goal

## Protocols and Technologies
*Protocols, stacks and building blocks for a decentralized web.*

### Federation & Social Protocols
- [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) - W3C Recommendation (2018) for federated social networking, defining server-to-server and client-to-server APIs; the protocol behind most of the Fediverse.
- [AT Protocol](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto) - The Authenticated Transfer Protocol, an open protocol for decentralized social networking with portable identities (DIDs), powering Bluesky; global views of the network rely on resource-intensive Relay and AppView services.
- [ForgeFed](https://github.com/forgefed/forgefed) - ActivityPub extension for federating software forges: a server-to-server API for pull requests, forks, and subscriptions; implemented experimentally by Forgejo.
- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) - Open specification for federated, persistent communication rooms whose history is replicated across every participating homeserver rather than owned by one; bridges connect it to other chat networks.
- [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) - Minimal protocol in which cryptographically signed notes are published to any number of independent relays; identity is a client-side keypair, and removing content requires every relay carrying it to cooperate.
- [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) - Offline-first gossip protocol that replicates signed append-only feeds between mutual follows over LAN or internet; no servers are required, though optional pub and room servers aid discovery.
- [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) - The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, an open IETF standard for federated messaging with thousands of independently operated servers.

### P2P Networking & Data Transfer
- [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.org/) - The dominant peer-to-peer file-distribution protocol, specified as open BEPs; swarms find each other through trackers or the Mainline DHT.

- [Named Data Networking](https://named-data.net/) - A content-centric Internet architecture with active research implementations such as NFD.
- [WebRTC](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) - W3C Recommendation (2021, with companion IETF RFCs) for direct browser-to-browser media and data channels; peers still need an application-provided signaling channel and commonly STUN/TURN servers to establish connections.

It uses a web of trust in high security mode, which makes users on the network very difficult to detect.
- [I2P](https://i2p.net/) - Decentralized garlic-routing overlay for hidden services and peer-to-peer applications; recent academic work documents design weaknesses across its implementations.
- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) - Onion-routing anonymity network, the base for onion services and the pluggable-transport ecosystem; repeatedly audited (most recently Cure53, 2023) with a publicly tracked vulnerability history.
